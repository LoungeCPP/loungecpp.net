title: The Rules
---
## Welcome to the Lounge!

We are [the best chatroom on Stack Overflow](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/10?m=8225803#8225803).
Let's get the biggest issue out of the way first.

### Can I ask programming-related questions in the chat?

In theory, you can. We even set up [best practices](/the-law/asking-q) at one point for how to properly ask.
You should read them, most of them are still relevant. However...

The Lounge is one of the (if not *the*) most active rooms on Stack Overflow. As a result, we got lots
of people who rushed in here to ask for help thinking they'll get their answer more quickly than on
the main site. At first we were happy to help, but after a while, many regulars got quite jaded,
and now the usual reaction is "go away".

Now, if you lurk for a while, you might realize that we have no problem in answering questions asked
by a regular. So what's going on? Well, we are a small community after all, and now it seems you have
to earn your "right to ask" in the Lounge by becoming part of that community. You can instead go to the  
[C++ Q&A chatroom](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/116940/c-questions-and-answers) to ask questions.
Someone will be lurking there most of the time so just ask there instead. And please, for the love of 
all that is nice and fluffy, don't act like we owe you something. You'll get flamed to death (and kicked).

With that in mind, introduce yourself, try participating in the various discussions, and have fun.
That's what the Lounge is about, after all.

## Tips for proper chatroom usage

**Read the [FAQ](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq) first!. Go to [Sandbox](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/1/sandbox)
if you want to try out chat features!**

### Basics of messages

* Messages that are one line can be up to 500 characters long. You can add newlines to make them bigger.
* Messages that are too big will be truncated and require users to explicitly expand them (they might also get binned).
* Messages are written using a trimmed down dialect of [Markdown](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq#formatting).
* When a message has more than one line, the only Markdown elements that work inside it are
  [block quote and code block](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/70141/70142#70142) (i.e. indentation).
* You can edit and delete your messages for 2 minutes after they were first posted
  (hover over the message and click the arrow next to the avatar to expand the menu with actions).
* History of your edits will be visible to everyone. History of your deleted messages will be visible to room owners.

### Inlining and linking

* Posting certain URLs by themselves will trigger inlining (also called oneboxing).
* Try not to inline Amazon links, they tend to result in boxes far too big.
* You can inline images (URL must end with a recognisable image extension). Animated GIFs are likely to be binned.
* Do not link to not-work-safe materials without appropriate warning. You might get kicked despite the warning though, depending on the nature of the link.
* Under no circumstances ever inline not-work-safe materials. You *will* be kicked.
* You can upload and immediately inline mages using the "upload" button. (They will be uploaded to Stack Exchange's instance of Imgur).

### Code

* Use backticks for inline code and indentation for code blocks (you can click "fixed font" that appears when your message has more
  than one line).
* Don't post large blocks of code inline: use [Coliru](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/) or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
  and post a link instead.
  Note: whatever size is considered "large" is completely arbitrary and depends on the current
  room owners present in the room, as well as their moods. The binning decisions are made ad-hoc
  and can be made by any room owner.
* Use Coliru or other online compiler especially if you're posting a test case.

### Pinging and replying

* You should [reply to specific messages](https://i.imgur.com/5zrvaV1.gif) when you're in a conversation.
* Replying to a message will ping the person you're replying to, and create a link between the two messages.
* You can also mention people without replying to a specific message using `@nick` form (also called a ping).
* Do not ping more people than necessary.
* You can reply to messages by using `:id` form. You can find the ID by checking message's permalink or
  using [chat extensions](https://github.com/rchern/StackExchangeScripts/).

### Starring and pinning

* Chat features 'starring', which puts the message on a starboard on the right.
* Spamming stars will invoke the wrath of the owners, and your stars will get cancelled. You might also get kicked.
* If there's a number to the right of a star, it indicates the number of people (>1) who have starred it.
  The more stars a message has, the further up it appears on that list, and the longer it stays there.
* Owners have the ability to pin items to the starboard: this keeps them on top for [up to 14 days](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/76929/76949#76949).
  These are usually announcements, important events and the like. Pay attention to them.

### Moderation

* Room owners have the ability to kick people who misbehave. You should report any issues to
  currently active owners first (they can be recognised by an italicised nick or found in the
  owner list on the [room's info page](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/10/loungec)).
* Kicking suspends the offender from the room they were kicked in. Suspension time
  [depends on the amount of times the offender was kicked before](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/229905/239226#239226).
* Issues with messages can be escalated to the entire chat by using the flag mechanism
  Note: every active user that has more than 10k reputation will be bothered with, and be able to act on
  the flagged message. Do not treat flags lightly.
* Flagging is done by clicking the flag icon (on the left when you hover over a message), or
  choosing "flag as spam/offensive" from the message menu.
* If [enough users](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/100414/100439#100439) will deem the flag to be
  valid, the offender will be automatically suspended from all rooms on the chat.
* You can escalate issues to site moderators by choosing "flag for moderator" option in the message
  menu (on the bottom, without the flag icon next to it). **Use this as a last resort.**
* **Abuse of the flag system will invoke the wrath of the entire chat.
  We will report any case of suspected abuse to the site moderators.
  This includes, but is not limited to, any form of revenge flagging.
  If you're not 100% sure your flag is valid, *don't flag*.**

### History

* The [transcript of the room](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/10) is public.
* You can (try to) search the transcript using the search box in the upper right corner, or
  by visiting [the search page](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/search?room=10&q=).
* You can also [browse the history of starred messages](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/10/loungec?tab=stars).

### Culture

* Abuse of acronyms is rampant in these parts. We have compiled [a list of most commonly used ones](/the-law/acronyms).
* We aim to have around 10 owners (picked usually from most active regulars), and possibly
  distributed around the world for more timezone coverage.
* There were some not-really-rules-more-guidelines set up [in the past](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/10?m=2264159#2264159)
  about ownership. They might or might not still apply.
* Kyrostat is not dead.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Some of the standard shortcuts supported by the chat. You can get more by installing
[chat extensions](https://github.com/rchern/StackExchangeScripts/).

Shortcut                 | Function
------------------------ | --------
<kbd>Enter</kbd>         | Send message, save edit
<kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd>   | Add a newline to the message
<kbd>↑</kbd>             | Enter edit mode (if message is single line and you have editable messages), go to previous message
<kbd>↓</kbd>             | In edit mode, go to next message
<kbd>Escape</kbd>        | Exit edit mode
<kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd>        | Toggle fixed font
<kbd>Tab</kbd>           | After typing `@`, choose between autocompleted nicks
