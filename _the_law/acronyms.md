Because of the endless waves of confusion, here's the most common acronyms used in the Lounge (YMMV).
Feel free to expand (no such thing as notability â€” but try not to invent new ones that nobody ever used).

If in doubt, you can look-up acronyms at [TheFreeDictionary](http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/).
Note that the list is not necessarily sorted.
