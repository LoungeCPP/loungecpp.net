title: First game jam
---
On the 6th of February 2014, a great competition took place in The Lounge: the 1st Great Lounge Game Jam.

Participants flocked in from all over the world, seeking fame and glory.

## Rules

We had very few rules. Two hours to write the code, from 21:30 to 23:30 GMT. Stick to the command-line. Pick two out of these themes: hack-me, time travel, randomness.

## Awards

We didn't pick a winner. It was fun.

### Special Awards

Award             | Game       | Reason
------------------|------------| -------
Most content      | suckage    | With a minimal engine and lots and lots of strings, this was certainly the most content heavy entry.
Most players      | SeriousJam | Two is more than one! SeriousJam stood out as the only multiplayer entry.
Most artistic     | Arbol      | It's just art, nothing else; how could it not be the most artistic?
Worst code fuckup | Dagon      | Using exceptions to control flow but not bothering to catch them deserves a special mention.
Best README       | Shit       | "AppWizard has created this Shit application for you."
