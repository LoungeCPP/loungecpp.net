{{Past event}}

On the 6th of February 2014, a great competition took place in The Lounge: the 1st Great Lounge Game Jam.

Participants flocked in from all over the world, seeking fame and glory.

== Rules ==

We had very few rules. Two hours to write the code, from 21:30 to 23:30 GMT. Stick to the command-line. Pick two out of these themes: hack-me, time travel, randomness.

= Awards =

We didn't pick a winner. It was fun.

== Special Awards ==

=== ''Most content:'' suckage ===
With a minimal engine and lots and lots of strings, this was certainly the most content heavy entry.

=== ''Most players:'' SeriousJam ===
Two is more than one! SeriousJam stood out as the only multiplayer entry.

=== ''Most artistic:'' Arbol ===
It's just art, nothing else; how could it not be the most artistic?

=== ''Worst code fuckup:'' Dagon ===
Using exceptions to control flow but not bothering to catch them deserves a special mention.

=== ''Best README:'' Shit ===
"AppWizard has created this Shit application for you."
