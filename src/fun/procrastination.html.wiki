[[Category:Fun]]
Welcome to the procrastination station, a place where we do even less than usual.
Since we're all nerds, we like to play games together. Here you'll find information on how you can join the fun.

= Comms =

We have a Mumble, fammit. It's run by LOUNGE OVERLORDS and can unsurprisingly be found at:

<code>loungecpp.net</code>

You can't check who's there, but you can create channels for games and stuff.

= Steam group =

We've also got a Steam group, which is supposed to be the main hub for organising gaming activity, but probably nobody
visits it. If you want to join, ping @RMartinhoFernandes or @CatPlusPlus with your Steam ID (it's in
steamcommunity.com URL of your profile â€” if you don't have a profile, make one).

The group is called Lounge<C++> (duh) and you can find it here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/lounge-cpp

= StarCraft 2 Group =

Yes, we play it. Log in to EU server (available since 2.0.5 patch for everyone!), and add Bajtek#751.

= Nomic =

We're playing Nomic, too! Check out http://nomic.loungecpp.net and join up!
