title: Commonly used acronyms
---
Because of the endless waves of confusion, here's the most common acronyms used in the Lounge (YMMV). Feel free to expand (no such thing as notability â€” but try not to invent new ones that nobody ever used).
If in doubt, you can look-up acronyms at [http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/ TheFreeDictionary]. Note that the list is not necessarily sorted.
