title: Pawnguy's Jam
---
With ~10 days of notice, the Pawnguy's Jam was [announced](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/22329924#22329924). The Jam is a commemoration of an old lost friend, Pawnguy. May his soul rest confused.

Jefffrey and others forfeited near the end leaving Andy alone. Cat got in, probably out of pity.

## Rules

There were no specific rules other than to have a snake game finished by the deadline.
