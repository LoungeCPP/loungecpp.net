== Welcome to the Lounge! ==

We are [http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/10?m=8225803#8225803 the best
chatroom on Stack Overflow]. Let's get the biggest issue out of the way first.

=== Can I ask programming-related questions in the chat? ===

In theory, you can. We even set up [[Asking questions|best practices]] at one
point for how to properly ask. You should read them, most of them are still
relevant. However...

The Lounge is one of the (if not ''the'') most active rooms on Stack Overflow.
As a result, we got lots of people who rushed in here to ask for help thinking
they'll get their answer more quickly than on the main site. At first we were
happy to help, but after a while, many regulars got quite jaded, and now the
usual reaction is "go away".

Now, if you lurk for a while, you might realize that we have no problem in
answering questions asked by a regular. So what's going on? Well, we are a
small community after all, and now it seems you have to earn your "right to
ask" in the Lounge by becoming part of that community. If you don't have time
for that, or don't care for that, then go on Stack Overflow instead. And
please, for the love of all that is nice and fluffy, don't act like we owe you
something. You'll get flamed to death.

With that in mind, introduce yourself, try participating in the various
discussions, and have fun. That's what the Lounge is about, after all.

== Tips for proper chatroom usage ==

=== What is there to know about writing messages in the chat? ===

Messages are one-liners by default and can be up to 500 characters long. You
can add a newline by pressing <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd>; such messages have no max
length (that any of us has run up against). Note that messages with too many
lines (according to a definition so far nobody has bothered to find out about)
will appear truncated, requiring users to click on an "expand" link to see them
in full.

You can '''''edit''''' your messages for 2mins. Click the <code>v</code> arrow
appearing left of it when you hover your mouse over it and pick "edit" from the
menu that appears. Also, <kbd>Cursor Up</kbd> will edit your last message
(doing it twice edits the one before that etc.), <kbd>Enter</kbd> confirms the
edit, <kbd>Escape</kbd> cancels it. The chat will keep a full history of your
editing, though, visible for the others. If you want to completely wipe out
something you said, you have to click on the "delete" link of the message's
menu (click <code>v</code> to see that) within those 2mins. Note that at least
room owners can ''still'' see your message as it was. Also, if it was quoted,
those quotes will remain visible.

'''''Markdown''''' [http://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq#formatting works pretty
much] like in comments on SO proper (there are subtle differences, though, like
newline working), but totally fails for multi-line messages (except for
fixed-width code and quotes; see below). Apparently,
[http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/70141/70142#70142 that's by design].
Short '''''inlined code snippets''''' can be formatted using
'''''backticks'''''. For posting longer snippets '''''indent all lines''''' of
a '''''multi-line message''''' with four spaces. There's also a "fixed font"
button appearing when your message has more than one line. Please paste longer
code snippets into [http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/ Coliru], it will compile
your snippet and display the error message, which can then be discussed, too.

'''''Links''''' to chat messages, to questions, answers, comments, and user
pages on the SE sites, and to images (URLs ending in <code>.jpg</code>, for
example) and specific web pages (Wikipedia articles, Twitter messages, XKCD
pages...) will '''''inline an excerpt''''' of the page, '''''when they are the
only text in a message'''''. (That's called "oneboxing" by the creators of this
chat.) There's also an "upload" button next to the input pane (only enabled
when the input pane is empty) that will upload an image to [http://imgur.com
imgur.com], and post a message with the (oneboxed) image.

Please make sure you're not posting any '''''animated gifs''''' so that they
will be oneboxed, because this makes them flicker over everybody's monitor
until we have managed to chat it off the screen. Also, not matter what your
local time is when you log in, some of the other participants might '''''be at
work''''', with their monitor in line of sight of a co-worker. Please bear in
mind this possibility when you post oneboxed pictures, and try to restrict
yourself to those that are not likely to get someone else in trouble.

=== AFAIK, and IIUC, TIL acronyms ===

If you don't know what those acronyms mean, you can have a look at the
[[Commonly used acronyms|list of common acronyms likely to be used in the
chat]].

=== Referring to users and messages ===

'''''Mentioning''''' others using the familiar <code>@syntax</code> will
'''''notify''''' them — audibly if they are in the chat (often referred to as
''plink''), and through the StackExchange inbox feature across the whole SE
network. The UI will '''''suggest matches''''' after you type @ and the first
letters. You can '''''cycle between the suggestions''''' using the
<kbd>Tab</kbd> key, accept by entering space, followed by your message.

'''''Refer''''' to specific messages by clicking on the down-and-right arrow
that appears at the right of all messages when you hover over them (or by
clicking the <code>v</code> arrow as mentioned above and picking "reply to this
message" from its menu). This will start the message with
<code>:NNNNNNN</code>, where <code>NNNNNN</code> is the message's ID. You can
also manually type the colon, followed by the ID. You can find any message's ID
in the permalink to the message, which you'll find beside the message's edit
menu item.

=== Can I upvote chat messages? ===

You can spend a limited number of '''''stars''''' per day on '''''messages you
like'''''. Recently starred messages are shown on the right. If there's a
number to the right of a star, it indicates the number of people (>1) who have
starred it. The more stars a message has, the further up it appears on that
list, and the longer it stays there.

Room owners can also '''''pin''''' messages to that area. (The message you
clicked on which linked to this was pinned.) Pinned messages are
[http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/76929/76949#76949 automagically
unpinned after 14 days].

=== Can I downvote chat messages? ===

No, just like with comments on Stack Overflow proper, you cannot downvote chat
messages. However, room owners have the possibility to remove stars and pins.

=== What if I consider a message offensive? ===

You can '''''flag messages''''' as spam/inappropriate/offensive by clicking
onto the small flag to the right of the message. If
[http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/100414/100439#100439 enough users]
flag a message, it will automatically be '''''deleted''''' by the system, and
the poster be '''''banned''''' for a while. Note that '''''all >10k users get
notified''''' about ''every flagged message'' '''''across all rooms of the
chat''''' and most of them find that '''''very annoying''''', especially when
done for silly reasons.

So please think thrice before flagging something. If a remark was not clearly
meant to be offensive, it is often much better to talk to the user directly and
telling them that, and why, you found some message offensive.

Messages can also be '''''brought to the attention of a moderator''''' (using
the message's popup). You can provide a small comment to the moderator.

=== Someone said something good yesterday, but it already fell of the list of
starred messages. How can I find this? ===

There is a [http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/10 transcript] of
everything said in the room as well as a
[http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/10/loungec?tab=stars list of starred
messages]. You can browse it. You can also '''''search for messages posted in
this room''''' using the find facility on the
[http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/10/loungec room's info page]. You can
also '''''search for messages posted by a certain user''''' using the find
facility on the user's info page (available by clicking on the user's avatar or
user name).

=== Why does this room have a dozen owners? Most of the other rooms don't have
half as many! ===

If you wonder why we have so many room owners: This room was originally created
by some user(s) who later disappeared, orphaning it, so that other users set up
a new C++ room. [http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/48456#48456 A
moderator objected against two C++ rooms], and transferred ownership of the
older C++ room to those who had created the new room (which was then left to
die).

To prevent this from ever happening again, we have the unofficial room policy
to turn regulars into owners (and to remove those no longer regulars in the
chat from the list of owners). Since it is therefore, in theory, possible for
everybody to become an owner of the room, which makes it a somewhat hot topic,
[http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/10?m=2263208#2263208 in a rather
lengthy discussion] we came up with
[http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/10?m=2264159#2264159 a few rules
regarding this]:

* Frequent users are likely to become owners, although actual ownership is by
the discretion of the owners.  * Frequency is determined by the frequent users
tab.  * We are lenient with kicking people off, but whoever falls off the
frequent users list might be kicked off at any time.  * Whoever behaves badly
might be kicked off by the discretion of an owner (a.k.a The Dick Rule™). (Note
that bitching — rather than ''objecting'' — about removal according to these
rules might be seen as bad behaviour and might prevent you from getting back on
the list any time soon.)

Yes, these are vague. That's no accident. The C++ room is a kind of anarchic
democracy, and it's intentionally prone to subjective feelings. It's a
''Lounge'', after all.

=== Where can I find more information? ===

There is the official '''''[http://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq chat FAQ]''''',
linked to from the "faq" link at the lower right corner of the chat browser's
window. (A small popup window showing just the
[http://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq#formatting formatting help of the FAQ] can
be invoked through the "help" link at the same place).
